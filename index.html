    <h2 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Malaysia Permanent Forest Reserve Density and Log Production of Each State</h2>
    <h1></h1>
    <h4 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Permanent Forest Reserve Area</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        Permanent Reserved Forests (PRFs) are government lands that have been gazetted under 
        the National Forestry Act 1984. Under the National Forestry Policy 1978 (Amendment 1992),
        PRFs must be managed and classified under four main functions: protection, production,
        recreation, and research. Sarawak, with the densest permanent forest reserve area, is a legally 
        protected area that ensures sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation, by 
        allowing controlled logging and community use as part of strict regulations. It plays a 
        vital role in conserving Sarawak's rich ecosystems, including endangered species, and is 
        part of larger initiatives such as the Heart of Borneo. Despite efforts towards certification 
        and sustainable practices, issues such as illegal logging and land use conflicts persist.

    <h4 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;" >Log Production</h4>
    <p style= "font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        Based on the data, Despite its lush PRFs, the production of wood log out of Sarawak is the biggest 
        contributor to the nation's log production. Altough, the production of year 2021 dropped significantly 
        compared to the last 20 years.
        Log production is regulated heavily by the Sarawak 
        Forestry Department to ensure sustainability of logging operations. 
        Logging activities mainly take place in designated areas such as permanent 
        forest reserves and licensed logging concessions.Despite regulatory efforts, 
        the industry continues to face challenges such as over-harvesting, illegal 
        logging, and concerns about deforestation and environmental sustainability.
